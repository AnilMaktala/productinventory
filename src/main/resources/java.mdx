# Java Development with Kiro

Kiro provides powerful AI-assisted development capabilities for Java projects, helping you write, debug, and maintain Java code more efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into Java development with Kiro, ensure you have:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Install the [latest LTS version](https://adoptium.net/) (JDK 17 or newer recommended)
- **Build Tool**: Maven or Gradle for dependency management and build automation
- **IDE Integration**: Kiro works alongside your existing Java development environment
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration

## Setting Up Your Java Environment

### JDK Installation and Configuration

Kiro can help you set up and configure your Java development environment:

```
"Help me install the latest JDK for my operating system"
"Configure JAVA_HOME environment variable on my system"
"Set up multiple JDK versions and switch between them"
```

### Project Configuration

Kiro can help you create and maintain configuration files for your Java projects:

```
"Create a new Maven project for a Spring Boot application"
"Set up a Gradle build file for my Android app"
"Add JUnit 5 dependencies to my Maven project"
```

### Project Structure

Kiro can help organize your Java project following best practices:

```
"Set up a standard Maven directory structure for my project"
"Create a multi-module Gradle project structure"
"Organize my Spring Boot application using a layered architecture"
```

## Kiro Tools with Java

### Code Analysis and Refactoring

Kiro can analyze your Java code to identify issues and suggest improvements:

- **Code Quality Analysis**: Ask Kiro to review your code for potential bugs, performance issues, or styling
- **Refactoring Assistance**: Get help extracting methods, renaming variables, or restructuring code
- **Design Pattern Implementation**: Kiro can help implement common design patterns in your Java code

Example prompts:
```
"Analyze this method for potential bugs or performance issues"
"Refactor this code to use the Builder pattern"
"Convert this imperative code to use Java Streams"
```

### Debugging Assistance

When you encounter errors in your Java code:

- **Error Explanation**: Kiro can explain cryptic error messages in plain language
- **Solution Suggestions**: Get actionable fixes for common errors
- **Runtime Debugging**: Kiro can help set up debugging configurations

Examples:
```
"Explain this NullPointerException in my code"
"Help me debug this ConcurrentModificationException"
"Analyze this stack trace and suggest a fix"
```

## Spec Driven Development

Kiro's [spec-driven development](/docs/features/specs) transforms how you build Java features by formalizing the development process from requirements to implementation:

1. **Create a Spec**: Define structured requirements with clear user stories and acceptance criteria
2. **Refine with Kiro**: Collaborate on technical design with architecture diagrams and component relationships
3. **Generate Implementation Plan**: Break down work into discrete, trackable tasks
4. **Execute Tasks**: Implement each task with Kiro's assistance, tracking progress throughout

### Spec Example: Building a RESTful API with Spring Boot

Let's walk through an example of using specs to build a RESTful API with Spring Boot:

#### 1. Creating the Spec

Start by asking Kiro to create a spec for your API:

```
"Create a spec for a Spring Boot RESTful API that manages a product inventory"
```

#### 2. The Generated Spec Files

Kiro will generate three key files:

**requirements.md** :
```markdown
# Product Inventory API Requirements

## User Stories

- As an inventory manager, I want to add new products to the inventory
- As a sales representative, I want to view available products
- As an administrator, I want to update product details
- As a system user, I want to remove discontinued products

## Acceptance Criteria

WHEN a user sends a POST request to /api/products
THE SYSTEM SHALL create a new product and return a 201 Created response

WHEN a user sends a GET request to /api/products
THE SYSTEM SHALL return a list of all products with a 200 OK response

WHEN a user sends a GET request to /api/products/{id}
THE SYSTEM SHALL return the product details with a 200 OK response
OR return a 404 Not Found if the product doesn't exist
...
```

**design.md** :
```markdown
# Product Inventory API Design

## Architecture

- Spring Boot backend with RESTful endpoints
- JPA/Hibernate for database access
- H2 database for development, PostgreSQL for production
- Spring Security for authentication and authorization

## Component Structure

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Controller --> Service
    Service --> Repository
    Repository --> Database
    Controller --> DTO
    Service --> Entity
    Entity --> DTO

## Data Models

```java
public class Product {
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private String description;
    private BigDecimal price;
    private Integer stockQuantity;
    private LocalDateTime createdAt;
    private LocalDateTime updatedAt;
    // Getters and setters
}
...
```

**tasks.md** :
```markdown
# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Project Setup and Core Infrastructure
  - [ ] 1.1 Initialize Spring Boot project with necessary dependencies
    - Create Spring Boot project with Spring Initializr
    - Add dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, H2, Lombok, Validation
    - Configure application.properties for development environment
    - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2_

  - [ ] 1.2 Set up project structure and package organization
    - Create packages for controllers, services, repositories, entities, and DTOs
    - Set up exception handling structure
    - Configure database connection
    - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.3_
...
```

#### 3. Implementing Tasks

After reviewing and approving the spec, you can ask Kiro to implement specific components:
Refer to [working with specs](/docs/features/specs/index.mdx) on running tasks using the UI. 
Alternatively, you can also ask Kiro to implement tasks:

```markdown
"Implement the Product entity and repository from my inventory API spec"
```

Kiro will generate the code for each component, following the architecture and design decisions documented in your spec.

#### 4. Iterating and Refining

As you test the implementation, you can refine components with Kiro:

```
"Add pagination to the product listing endpoint"
"Implement filtering by product category"
"Add validation for product price and stock quantity"
```

The spec remains your source of truth throughout development, ensuring consistency and tracking progress across the entire feature.

## Steering

[Steering](/docs/features/steering) allows you to provide Kiro with project specific context and guidelines. Kiro can generate steering files which you can refine:

1. **Product brief** (`product.md`) - Contains information about the product, its purpose, and key features
2. **Technical Stack** (`tech.md`) - Details the technologies, frameworks, and development guidelines
3. **Project Structure** (`structure.md`) - Provides information about how the project is organized

For Java projects, you can create additional custom steering files to provide more specific guidance:

### Creating Custom Steering Files

To add new steering documents to your project:

1. Navigate to the Kiro panel in your IDE
2. Locate the Steering section
3. Click the `+` button to create a new steering file
4. Name your file with a descriptive title
5. Add your custom steering content following markdown conventions

Custom steering files are stored in the `.kiro/steering/` directory and are automatically recognized by Kiro during interactions.

### Code Style and Conventions

For example, you can define custom naming conventions, file structure or practices for your Java project.
Create a `java-conventions.md` steering file to define your team's coding standards:

```markdown
# Java Conventions

## Naming Conventions
- Use camelCase for variables and methods
- Use PascalCase for classes and interfaces
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Prefix interfaces with 'I' (e.g., IUserService)

## Package Structure
- Use reverse domain name notation (com.company.project)
- Group related classes in packages
- Follow the standard Maven/Gradle directory structure

## Java Practices
- Follow the SOLID principles
- Use constructor injection for dependencies
- Prefer immutable objects where appropriate
- Use Optional for nullable return values
```

### Framework Specific Guidelines

For Spring Boot projects, create a `spring-boot-patterns.md` steering file:

```markdown
# Spring Boot Development Guidelines

## Component Structure
- Use @RestController for REST endpoints
- Use @Service for business logic
- Use @Repository for data access
- Use @Component for other beans

## Dependency Injection
- Prefer constructor injection over field injection
- Use final fields for injected dependencies
- Avoid circular dependencies

## API Design
- Follow REST principles for endpoint design
- Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Use DTOs for request/response objects
```

These steering files help Kiro generate code that follows your team's specific conventions and best practices.

## Agent Hooks

Kiro's [Agent Hooks](/docs/features/hooks) can automate common Java development tasks:

1. Navigate to the **Agent Hooks** section in the Kiro panel
2. Click the **+** button to create a new hook
3. Define the hook workflow in natural language

Here are some hook examples:

#### Test Generation Hook

Automatically generate tests when you save a Java file:

```
"Create a hook that generates JUnit tests when I save a new Java class"
```

#### Code Quality Hook

Run code quality checks in the background:

```
"Set up a hook to run Checkstyle when I save Java files"
```

#### Dependency Update Hook

Keep your dependencies up to date:

```
"Create a hook that checks for outdated Maven dependencies"
```

#### JavaDoc Generation Hook

```
When a Java file is saved:
1. Check if JavaDoc comments are missing or incomplete
2. Generate or update JavaDoc for public methods and classes
3. Follow the project's documentation standards
```

#### Spring Boot Configuration Hook

```
When application.properties or application.yml is modified:
1. Validate the configuration against Spring Boot documentation
2. Check for deprecated properties
3. Suggest security improvements for sensitive properties
4. Ensure consistent formatting
```
