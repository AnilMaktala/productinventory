# Session Management Guidelines

## Task Execution Strategy
- Execute each new major task or feature in a separate chat session
- This ensures clean context and prevents confusion between different objectives
- Maintain focus on single responsibility per session

## Context Management
- Use #File or #Folder references to include specific context
- Reference steering documents and specs when relevant
- Keep conversations focused on the current task scope

## Development Workflow
- Start new sessions for:
  - Each new task in the task.md file
  - New feature development
  - Bug fixes unrelated to current work
  - Refactoring tasks
  - Testing different approaches
- Continue existing sessions for:
  - Iterative improvements on current feature
  - Related bug fixes
  - Code reviews and refinements

## Best Practices
- Clearly state the objective at the beginning of each session
- Reference relevant specs, steering docs, and context files
- Maintain consistent coding standards across sessions
- Document decisions and rationale for future reference
