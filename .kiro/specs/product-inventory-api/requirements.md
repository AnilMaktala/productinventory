# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Product Inventory Management System consisting of a Spring Boot RESTful API backend and a React frontend. The system will allow users to create, read, update, and delete products in the inventory, as well as manage inventory levels, categories, and search functionality. The backend will provide a robust API for inventory management, while the frontend will offer an intuitive user interface for interacting with the system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Product Management

**User Story:** As an inventory manager, I want to create, view, update, and delete products in the inventory, so that I can maintain an accurate catalog of available items.

5. WHEN a user sends a DELETE request to '/api/categories/{id}' THEN the system SHALL remove the category if it has no associated products and return a 204 No Content response.
6. WHEN a user sends a GET request to '/api/categories/{id}/products' THEN the system SHALL return all products in the specified category.
7. WHEN a user sends a PUT request to '/api/products/{id}/category' with a category ID THEN the system SHALL assign the product to the specified category.

### Requirement 4: Search and Filtering

**User Story:** As an inventory user, I want to search and filter products based on various criteria, so that I can quickly find specific items in the inventory.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a GET request to '/api/products/search' with a 'name' query parameter THEN the system SHALL return products matching the name pattern.
2. WHEN a user sends a GET request to '/api/products/search' with a 'category' query parameter THEN the system SHALL return products in the specified category.
3. WHEN a user sends a GET request to '/api/products/search' with a 'minPrice' and/or 'maxPrice' query parameters THEN the system SHALL return products within the specified price range.
4. WHEN a user sends a GET request to '/api/products/search' with an 'inStock' query parameter set to true THEN the system SHALL return only products that have inventory greater than zero.
5. WHEN a user sends a GET request to '/api/products/search' with multiple query parameters THEN the system SHALL return products that match all specified criteria.

### Requirement 5: Data Validation and Error Handling

**User Story:** As an API user, I want proper validation and clear error messages, so that I can identify and fix issues with my requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API request contains invalid data THEN the system SHALL return a 400 Bad Request response with specific validation error details.
2. WHEN any API request attempts to access a non-existent resource THEN the system SHALL return a 404 Not Found response.
3. WHEN any API request is made with invalid authentication or authorization THEN the system SHALL return a 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden response as appropriate.
4. WHEN any server error occurs THEN the system SHALL return a 500 Internal Server Error with a generic error message (without exposing sensitive information).
5. WHEN any API request is made with an unsupported HTTP method THEN the system SHALL return a 405 Method Not Allowed response.

### Requirement 6: API Documentation

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want comprehensive API documentation, so that I can understand how to use the API correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the API documentation endpoint THEN the system SHALL provide Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for all available endpoints.
