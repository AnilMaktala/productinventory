# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables the deployment of the Product Inventory API application to AWS cloud infrastructure. The deployment should provide a scalable, secure, and cost-effective solution that supports both development and production environments. The system will leverage AWS services to ensure high availability, automatic scaling, and proper monitoring while maintaining the existing H2 database for development and introducing RDS for production environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy the Product Inventory API to AWS, so that the application is accessible from the internet and can handle production workloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the deployment process is initiated THEN the system SHALL create AWS infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code
2. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL be accessible via a public URL with HTTPS enabled
3. WHEN the deployment completes THEN the system SHALL provide health check endpoints that return successful responses
4. IF the deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages and rollback capabilities

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to automatically scale based on demand, so that it can handle varying traffic loads efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CPU utilization exceeds 70% THEN the system SHALL automatically scale up additional instances
2. WHEN CPU utilization drops below 30% for 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL scale down instances
3. WHEN scaling occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain at least 2 instances for high availability
4. WHEN maximum capacity is reached THEN the system SHALL log alerts and maintain performance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want separate environments for development and production, so that I can test changes safely before deploying to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to development environment THEN the system SHALL use cost-optimized resources and H2 database
2. WHEN deploying to production environment THEN the system SHALL use RDS PostgreSQL database with backup enabled
3. WHEN environment variables are configured THEN each environment SHALL have isolated configurations
4. IF database migration is required THEN the system SHALL handle schema updates automatically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want the deployment to follow AWS security best practices, so that the application and data are protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the infrastructure is created THEN all resources SHALL be deployed in private subnets where applicable
2. WHEN database connections are established THEN they SHALL use encrypted connections and secure credentials
3. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN they SHALL require HTTPS and proper authentication
4. WHEN logs are generated THEN they SHALL be encrypted and stored securely in CloudWatch

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an operations team member, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor application performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL send logs to AWS CloudWatch with appropriate log levels
2. WHEN system metrics are collected THEN they SHALL include CPU, memory, disk usage, and application-specific metrics
3. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL trigger alerts via SNS notifications
4. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide detailed metrics for troubleshooting

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious stakeholder, I want the deployment to be cost-optimized, so that we minimize AWS expenses while maintaining required performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resources are provisioned THEN they SHALL use appropriate instance types for the workload
2. WHEN traffic is low THEN the system SHALL scale down to minimum required instances
3. WHEN storage is allocated THEN it SHALL use cost-effective storage classes with lifecycle policies
4. WHEN development environment is not in use THEN it SHALL support automated shutdown schedules

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a deployment engineer, I want automated CI/CD pipeline integration, so that code changes can be deployed automatically after successful testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to main branch THEN the system SHALL trigger automated deployment to development environment
2. WHEN development tests pass THEN the system SHALL allow promotion to production environment
3. WHEN deployment fails THEN the system SHALL automatically rollback to previous stable version
4. WHEN deployment succeeds THEN the system SHALL run smoke tests to verify functionality
